# Project Title: Thrive X

## Description:
 Thrive X is a mobile portfolio app designed to help students showcase their skills, experiences, and personal stories to potential employers, coaches, and recruiters. Built using Flutter and Firebase, the app allows users to create dynamic, professional profiles with sections like Projects, Work Experience, Certificates, and more.
